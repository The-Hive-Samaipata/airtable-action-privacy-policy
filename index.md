# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** June 11, 2025

This privacy policy describes how we handle data when you use our OpenAI custom action that reads from our Airtable base titled "Iter–BolsaTrabajos".

## 1. Information We Access

The custom action accesses **read-only** data from a specific Airtable base. The following applies:

- Only the **fields and records made available** in the “Jobs” table are retrieved.
- No user-identifiable information is collected, stored, or transmitted.
- The Airtable API is used in a **read-only mode**, and no data is created, edited, or deleted.

## 2. Authentication

Access to Airtable is secured using a **personal access token**, which is securely stored and never exposed in client interfaces.

## 3. Data Storage

No data from Airtable is persisted or stored on any servers. The action only relays the requested data from Airtable to OpenAI's API and returns it directly to the user.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do **not** share any data retrieved from Airtable with third parties. The data is only used to fulfill the request made via the OpenAI custom action.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our data practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify users by updating the date at the top of this policy.
